# mans-best-friend

This is my final project for Code Louisville; my first website created. I have used a mobie-out approach where the main navigation bar goes from column at mobile size to row at full size. Also at mobile size I have added borders around my h2 headings and made the paragraphs into a single column where they once were in rows as well at the desktop size. Using CSS I created a "fun facts" list that incorporates nth-child properties.
