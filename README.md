# mans-best-friend

This is my final project for Code Louisville; my first website created. I have used a mobile-out approach where the main navigation bar goes from vertical at mobile size under the main header picture to horizontal at desktop size. Also at mobile size I have added borders around my h2 headings and made the paragraphs into a single column where they once were in rows as well at the desktop size with flexbox. Using CSS I created a "fun facts" list that incorporates nth-child properties. I added an HTML form. Using Javascript I prompted the user to enter their three favorite dog breeds, then I displayed this at the bottom of the page before the "contact us" form.


*There are two html files. The one to use is index.html.*
